Website i made for fun.
The website is for an imaginary gaming cafe. I made a navigation bar, but only finished one of the pages which is the "consoles", this site displays all 
the consols that would be available in the gaming cafe and a text about each of them. I also played around with media query which makes the site 
usable on phones aswell as on a computer.
